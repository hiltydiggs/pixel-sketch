# Pixel Sketch
--------------

This project uses jQuery to create an Etcha-Sketch replica. Hovering over the canvas will begin drawing. The size/pixel count is adjustable and there are three color modes:
- Black and White - Just as it sounds
- Color Mode - Every square is assigned a random RGB color
- Darken Mode - Progressively darker greyscale with every pass
